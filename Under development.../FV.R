FV <- function(r,cashflow,n,r.type,chronology){
  # Computes the Future Value (FV) of a cashflow.
  # 
  # Args:
  #   r:        the interest rate
  #   cashflow: a vector of cashflows
  #
  # Returns: 
  #   The Future Value of the cashflow.

  # TODO(DD): The idea is to have a central function
  #           that implements all flavors of the algo
  #           depending on the input parameters
